My home town is Zhigulevsk, a small city in the Samara Region of Russia, located on the right bank of the Volga River. It is surrounded by the Zhiguli Mountains, which give the city a distinctive landscape and a strong conneSction to nature. Forests, hills, and river views are an essential part of everyday life here.

Zhigulevsk is known for its calm atmosphere and close-knit community. Unlike large industrial cities, it offers a slower pace of life, where people value simplicity, reliability, and mutual support. The city’s history is closely linked to the development of the region and to the Volga, which has always played an important economic and cultural role.

For me, Zhigulevsk is more than just a place on the map. It is a city of personal memories, quiet streets, and natural beauty that shaped my character and my sense of home.
